Instasave
=========

Instasave is a "rainy day" project. I was annoyed that instagram provides no easy web based way to save photos, so I quickly wrote a *very* hacky OSX app to download individual photos or entire user profiles. Instasave uses parses raw html to find links to the photos hosted on amazon's webservers. HTML parsing is a terrible way to do this, or anything, but unfortunetly [Instagram's API](http://instagram.com/developer/) forbids developers from saving photos. At the time I wrote this it was fully functional, provided the target picture or profile was public, but it would not take much for instagram to break my method. *Note:* This app **Will NOT** be supported.


#Usage

Simply enter the URL of a public photo or profile and hit return or press "Save".
